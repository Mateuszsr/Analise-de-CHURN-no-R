## Business problem

Bank's Credit Card Service Churn Prediction  
In this project, I will build a machine learning model to predict customer's probability of churning in a bank's credit card service. It involves supervised learning (using a labeled training set) for classification, where the target is 1 if the customer churned, else 0.

I will use the following pipeline based on CRISP-DM framework:

1. Define the business problem.
2. Collect the data and get a general overview of it.
3. Split the data into train and test sets.
4. Explore the data (exploratory data analysis)
5. Feature engineering, data cleaning and preprocessing.
6. Model training, comparison, feature selection and tuning.
7. Final production model testing and evaluation.
8. Conclude and interpret the model results.
9. Deploy.

In this notebook, I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), covering steps 1 to 4 of the pipeline above. The main objective here is to uncover insights that will give us valuable information about churners' patterns within the available features. Thus, even before building a model, it will be possible to help the bank with some churners profiles and tendencies. Furthermore, I will approach these steps in detail below, explaining why I am making each decision.

### 1. Business problem
A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them how likely is a customer to churn so they can proactively go to the customers to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

#### 1.1 What is the context?

When a bank acquires a customer for its credit card service, three essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to consider include:

1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): This measures the expenses associated with acquiring each credit card customer, encompassing marketing, sales, and related costs. Lower CAC reflects efficient customer acquisition.

2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): CLV estimates the total revenue the bank can expect to generate from a credit card customer over their relationship. A higher CLV indicates that the customer's value surpasses the acquisition cost, ensuring long-term profitability.

3. Churn Rate: Churn rate is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the number of credit card customers who have left during a specific period divided by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period.

These KPIs help the bank assess the effectiveness of its strategies in acquiring credit card customers and gauge the potential long-term financial benefit of these acquisitions.

In order to maximize profitability, the bank aims to minimize CAC and Churn while maximizing CLV.

**Which are the project objectives?**

1. Identify the factors associated with customer churn.
2. Construct a model capable of accurately predicting the probability of a customer to churn.
3. Offer action plans for the bank to reduce credit card customer churn.

**Why the probability/score ordering approach?**

When deploying the model so that the bank can make predictions, the primary objective is to generate probability scores for each customer. This is typically more valuable for businesses when compared to making binary predictions (1/0), as it enables better decision-making and more effective customer retention strategies.
For instance, predicting the probability of churn provides more actionable insights. Instead of simply determining whether a customer will churn or not, you gain an understanding of how likely it is to happen. This information enables the bank to allocate its efforts and resources more effectively. For example, it can concentrate its retention efforts on customers with a high probability of churning, ordering the customer from the most likely to churn to the less likely.

**Which are the benefits?**

1. Cost Savings  
2. Improved Customer Retention  
3. Enhanced Customer Experience  
4. Targeted Marketing  
5. Revenue Protection

And as a result, the mentioned business problem will be resolved.
